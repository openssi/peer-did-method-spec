<h2>DID docs</h2>

<section>
    <h3>Backing Storage</h3>

    <p>At first glance, it might seem that parties dealing in peer DID docs could just store raw DID docs.
        However, this is not the case. Any time a DID doc evolves, proof that the evolution is authorized must be found
        in the DID doc's previous state. If an agent is offline for an extended period (e.g., a phone is lost in the
        couch cushions for a week), multiple evolutions may have occurred by the time it reconnects--and it cannot
        accept the latest state of the doc without validating the sequence of changes it underwent to get there. Agents
        must be able to prove to one another that the state they hold is correct, and they must be able to answer
        questions about <em>what</em> the state used to be, and <em>who</em> authorized <em>which</em> changes, <em>when
        </em>.
    </p>
    <p>This means that peer DID docs need to be associated with some type of <dfn>backing storage</dfn> that adds
        metadata and history to the simple content of the docs themselves.
    </p>
    <p>The backing storage for peer DID docs is therefore a sequence of <dfn>deltas</dfn>. Each delta is a JSON object
        in this form:</p>
    <pre>
{
    "id": &lt;a UUID&gt;,
    "change": &lt;base64 encoding of a change fragment&gt;,
    "by": [ {"key": &lt;id of key&gt;, "sig": &lt;signature value&gt;} ... ],
    "when": &lt;ISO8601 UTC timestamp with at least second precision&gt;
}
    </pre>
    <p>Here, a <dfn>change fragment</dfn> is a sparse version of a DID doc that shows just the section being
        updated. The <code>by</code> property contains one or more key+signature pairs over the raw (non-base64-encoded)
        JSON text of the change fragment, and <code>when</code> contains a value supplied by the system clock. This
        value is like timestamps on an email header&mdash;not guaranteed to be highly accurate, but useful for rough
        analysis.
    </p>
    <p>Deltas are like database transactions, in that they may embody multiple changes that must be performed together.
        For example, key rotation involves both a key addition and a key deletion, performed as a unit.
        All changes in a single delta MUST share a common authorization; it is invalid to combine into one delta changes
        requiring two different authorizations, as this makes authorization of each individual change ambiguous.
    </p>
    <p>A resolved peer DID doc at any given point in time is a view or projection of the cumulative effect of all
        known deltas up to that point, with resolution adding the DID value itself to the composite <a>stored
        variant</a> of DID doc data.
    </p>
    <p class="note">Early explorations of this DID method used the term <dfn>microledger</dfn> for backing storage. This
        term has some resonance, in that backing storage is an append-only record of immutable transactions. However,
        we have chosen not to emphasize the term here, because it may feel intimidating to some, and because the actual
        storage mechanism in an implementation of this method could be a simple file, a database, or anything else that
        provides equivalent features.
    </p>
    <p>In the discussion about generating a <a>numeric basis</a> for a peer DID, the <a>genesis version</a> of a peer
        DID doc was defined. The genesis version is the one associated with the first delta committed to backing
        storage. In the first delta, <code>change</code> contains the genesis state of the doc, <code>by</code> holds
        a signature from any key defined internally in the genesis state, and <code>when</code> is populated by the
        system clock.
    </p>
    <p class="note">The genesis state can be authorized by <em>any</em> internally defined key, even if that key has a very
        limited <a>trust profile</a>. This is because the authorization for genesis state is only proving that the
        creator of the DID doc has not been shadowed by a malicious man-in-the-middle; no other test of authorization
        is performed.
    </p>

    <h3>CRDTs</h3>

    <p>Because peer DID docs can be updated by multiple parties at the same time (as when two agents of the same identity
        owner rotate their keys without coordinating), they have the potential for merge conflicts. Resolving these
        merge conflicts could introduce much complexity in our DID method. However, peer DID docs use a clever
        technique that avoids much of the pain. The backing storage for peer DID docs is carefully defined to
        be a <a target="wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">conflict-free
        replicated data type</a> (<dfn>CRDT</dfn>).</p>
    <p>CRDTs are a deep subject unto themselves, with a body of academic research; additional study is recommended.
        They are behind familiar experiences like simultaneous, distributed editing of Google Docs, which never raises
        error messages about merge conflicts. Here, we will not explain their theory; we will simply note some key
        requirements that they impose on DID docs and their <a>backing storage</a>.</p>
    <ol id="crdt-rules">
        <li>Core building blocks&mdash;keys, rules, and service endpoints&mdash; must be assigned
            <code>id</code> properties in a way that prevents collisions.</li>
        <li>All items with <code>id</code> properties must be immutable. They can be deleted, but they can never have
            a different state than they were created with. The effect of modifying an item can be achieved by
            deleting an old item and replacing it with a new item that has a different <code>id</code> and updated
            properties.</li>
        <li>Deleting an item is accomplished by adding its <code>id</code> to a <dfn>deletion list</dfn>. This list
            is a root property of the <a>stored variant</a> of a DID doc and is named <code>deleted</code>. It is
            suppressed when generating a <a>resolved variant</a> of the DID doc, so it is only visible in the deltas
            of <a>backing storage</a>. See <a href="#deleting-a-publickey">this clarifying example</a>.</li>
        <li>When any party encounters two versions of a peer DID doc, one of which has an item in undeleted state and
            one of which has the item in a deleted state, the item's state should be considered deleted, regardless
            of relative timing of the two versions. This eliminates the possibility that a malicious party could
            attempt to take advantage of differences in system clocks or sequencing.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These rules do not guarantee that conflicting state can never exist. However, they eliminate most ordering
        concerns, and they provide a framework that allows conflicting state to be resolved automatically. No human
        judgment is ever required, and all non-malicious parties to a relationship will agree on the proper course of
        action in every circumstance. Details about CRDT requirements are documented below, in the sections about
        individual parts of the DID doc. These will make the CRDT semantics and the technique clearer.</p>

    <h3><code><dfn>publicKey</dfn></code></h3>

    <p>The <code>publicKey</code> section of a peer DID document, in either stored or resolved form, is as you would
        expect from a reading of the <a target="didspec" href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#authentication">DID
        spec</a>. Peer DID docs MUST define all of their internal and external keys in this section; although the DID
        spec permits inline definitions in the <code>authentication</code> and <code>authorization</code> sections of a
        DID doc, this DID method removes that option to simplify the possible permutations of a <a>change fragment</a>.
    </p>
    <p>All <code>id</code> properties associated with a key defined internally in the DID doc MUST be in
        relative, not absolute form (that is, "#xyz" instead of "did:peer:abc#xyz"). IDs for keys defined
        interally may be generated in either of these two ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The first 8 characters of the key's unique representation may be used as the <code>id</code>, if this
            provides enough uniqueness within the document. (Global uniqueness is irrelevant.) For example, if the
            key is defined with a <code>publicKeyBase58</code> property value that begins with <code>H3C2AVvL</code>,
            then its <code>id</code> would be <code>H3C2AVvL</code>; a key with a <code>publicKeyHex</code> property
            that begins with <code>02b97c30</code> would have an <code>id</code> of <code>02b97c30</code>, and a key
            with a <code>publicKeyPem</code> property that begins, after its <code>-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY</code>
            delimiter, with the value <code>izfrNTmQ</code>, would have an <code>id</code> of <code>izfrNTmQ</code>.
        </li>
        <li>A standard 128-bit UUID of type 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 (see [[RFC4122]]), rendered with hyphens and in lower
            case, may be used as the<code>id</code> instead.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">All IDs in DID docs, including these, should be considered case-sensitive. Ignoring case will result
        in invalid comparisons for key <code>id</code>s based on encodings that are not hex.
    </p>
    <p>Because peer DIDs usually operate independent of global registries, external references (where <code>controller</code>
        is not <code>#id</code>) will probably be rare, with the possible exception of <a target="aries"
                href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0046-mediators-and-relays/README.md">
            mediator</a> keys that have the <a>route</a> privilege.
    </p>

    <pre class="example" title="A publicKey section">
{
  ...
  "publicKey": [
    {
      "id": "H3C2AVvL",
      "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
      "controller": "#id",
      "publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
    }, {
      "id": "02b97c30",
      "type": "Secp256k1VerificationKey2018",
      "controller": "#id",
      "publicKeyHex": "02b97c30de767f084ce3080168ee293053ba33b235d7116a3263d29f1450936b71"
    }, {
      "id": "izfrNTmQ",
      "type": "RsaVerificationKey2018",

      "publicKeyPem": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY\r\nizfrNTmQ...END PUBLIC KEY-----\r\n"
    }
  ]
  ...
}
    </pre>

    <p class="note">This DID method is relatively agnostic with respect to key types. However, elliptic curve
        keys (Ed25519, Secp256, etc) are recommended because the keys are smaller, the number
        of bits of security are greater, and the computations more efficient, than RSA key types.
    </p>

    <section>
        <h4 id="adding-a-publickey">Adding a key</h4>

        <p>To add a new key with <code>id</code> = <code>Mv6gmMNa</code> to a peer DID doc, you might create
        a <a>change fragment</a> of the DID doc that looks like this:
        </p>

        <pre class="example" title="Change fragment that adds a new key">
{
    "publicKey": [
        {
          "id": "Mv6gmMNa",
          "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
          "controller": "#id",
          "publicKeyBase58": "Mv6gmMNam3uVAjH3C2AVvLZZn6z3wXmqPVpfkcJCwDwn"
        }
    ],
    "authorization": { "profiles": [ {"key": "#Mv6gmMNa", "roles", ["edge"]} ] }
}
        </pre>

        <p>Change fragments only show where something is <em>appended</em> to either normal lists or the <a>deletion
            list</a>. Here, the single entries under <code>publicKey</code> and <code>authorization.profiles</code> are
            additions, not replacements, to the lists that already contain values. (The <a>trust profile</a> embodied in
            the<code>authorization.profiles</code> associates the new key with privileges. This must be done at creation
            time. It is discussed under <a href="#authorization"><code>authorization</code></a>.) The <a>delta</a> that
            encapsulates this update would take the above JSON text, base64-encode it, and assign the result to the
            delta's <code>change</code> property. It would need to be authorized by a key with the <a>key_admin</a>
            privilege, evidenced in the delta's <code>by</code> field. The resulting delta might look like this:
        </p>
        <pre class="example" title="Delta that adds a new key">
{
    "id": "040aaa5e-1a27-40d8-8d53-13a00b82d235",

    </section>

    <section>
        <h4 id="deleting-a-publickey">Deleting a key</h4>

        <p>Any key can be deleted by appending its <code>id</code> to the <code>deleted</code> list at the root of
            the stored version of a peer DID doc, and by removing its corresponding entry from the <code>publicKey</code>
            section. Only the append-to-<code>deleted</code> operation needs to be represented in the <a>change
            fragment</a>; the corresponding removal from the <code>publicKey</code> section is implied. For example, to
            delete a key with <code>id</code> = <code>izfrNTmQ</code>, your <a>change fragment</a> would look like
            this:
        </p>
        <pre class="example" title="Change fragment that deletes a key">
{
    "deleted": [ "izfrNTmQ" ]
}
        </pre>
        <p>This fragment would be base64-encoded and signed in a corresponding delta, in much the same way that
        the fragment was handled in the example about adding a key.</p>

<section>
    <h3><code><dfn>authentication</dfn></code></h3>
    <p>The <code>authentication</code> section of a peer DID document conforms to <a target="didspec"
            href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#authentication">standard practice described in the DID spec</a>,
        with the constraint that only references, not inline key definitions, are allowed. Any keys referenced
        here may be used to authenticate or login as the DID.
    </p>
    <p>However, the meaning of "authenticate" or "login" deserves comment, because there is a tendency in DID
        circles to reference too many keys in this section, and because heavy use of this section is discouraged
        with peer DIDs.
    </p>
    <p>A <dfn>sovereign domain</dfn> (the scope of things under the control of a single, sovereign identity owner) may
        include keys that represent the identity owner with greater or lesser degrees of trust. For example, the
        identity owner may hold one key on paper, locked in a safe; she may hold another key on a mobile device's
        secure enclave, protected by a biometric; she may hold a third key on a server in a config file protected
        only by an ACL. These keys may all be legitimate evidence that the DID subject is interacting, but
        they are not equally strong evidence. Only the strongest forms of evidence should be accepted as a
        basis for authentication when stakes are high.</p>
    <p>This is not unlike what happens on the political landscape. A low-level diplomat and the president / premier
        / prime minister of a nation are both authentic representatives of their people&mdash;but the scope of their
        privileges, and the concomitant trust, are different. Only the highest-level officials should be signing
        binding international treaties.
    </p>
    <p>The <a href="#authorization"><code>authorization</code> section</a> of peer DID docs, described next, is
        where fine-grained privileges are described. The <code>authentication</code> section is a blunt instrument,
        incapable of distinguishing between these levels of trust, and incapable of associating trust with anything
        more complex than a single key. It is supported for historical reasons, and because most so-called "DID
        Authentication" use cases assume it will be populated. With peer DIDs, the strong recommendation is that
        only keys held by the most trusted proxies should be referenced here&mdash;only list the equivalent of your
        president / premier / prime minister keys in this section, not the equivalent of keys for your low-level
        diplomats. This will prevent impersonation by less trusted keys when stakes are high.
    </p>
    <section>
        <h4 id="adding-key-to-authn">Adding a key</h4>
        <p>As mentioned earlier, all objects having an <code>id</code> property in peer DID docs are immutable. This
            means that a key cannot change its status with respect to the <code>authentication</code> section of a peer
            DID doc during its lifetime in that doc; it must be declared as an authentication key when it is first
            defined. A <a>change fragment</a> for adding an internally defined key and giving it status in the
            <code>authentication</code> section at the same time might look like this:
        </p>
        <pre class="example" title="Change fragment that adds a new key with authentication privileges">
{
    "publicKey": [
        {

          "publicKeyBase58": "Mv6gmMNam3uVAjH3C2AVvLZZn6z3wXmqPVpfkcJCwDwn"

        <p class="note">Adding a key with authentication privileges can only be authorized by a key that has the
            <a>key_admin</a> privilege.</p>

        <h4 id="deleting-key-from-authn">Deleting a key</h4>
        <p>Because a key's authentication privileges are immutable, the only way to take away authentication
        privileges from a key is to remove it entirely from the DID doc. See

    </section>
</section>

<section>
    <h3><code><dfn>authorization</dfn></code></h3>

    <p class="note">This section of a peer DID docs governs how DID docs are updated and DIDComm trust flows. It doesn't
        contemplate custom authorization schemes such as peers might develop to give each other spending limits or
        access to sensitive data. Those matters are better formalized with something like a verifiable credential, or a
        simple digitally signed permission slip.
    </p>

    <p>Peer DID docs organize their <code>authorization</code> section into two lists. The first, <code>profiles
    </code>, gives a <dfn>trust profile</dfn> for each key, as expressed by named roles the key holds. These
        named roles are arbitrary strings chosen by the implementer; since they are only used to match against
        rules in the second list, their meaning in normal language does not need to be understood by a party
        wishing to support correct semantics.
    </p>
    <p class="note">Changes to the <code>profiles</code> list MUST be performed when a key is added or deleted;
    the <a>trust profile</a> of a key cannot change after it is created.</p>
    <p>The second list contains <a href="https://evernym.github.io/sgl" target="sgl">SGL</a> rules that grant
        privileges according to named roles. Here is an example:
    </p>

    <pre class="example" title="An authorization section">
“authorization”: {
    "profiles": [
        {"key": "#Mv6gmMNa", "roles", ["edge"]},              // an "edge" key
        {"key": "#izfrNTmQ", "roles", ["edge", "biometric"]}, // an "edge" and a "biometric" key
        {"key": "#02b97c30", "roles", ["cloud"]},             // a "cloud" key
        {"key": "#H3C2AVvL", "roles", ["offline"]},           // an "offline" key
    ],
    "rules": [
        {
            "grant": ["route", "authcrypt"],
            "when": {"roles": "cloud"},
            "id": "98c2c9cc"
        },
        {
            "grant": ["authcrypt", "plaintext", "sign"],
            "when": {"roles": "edge"},
            "id": "e1e7d7bc"
        },
        {
            "grant": ["key_admin", "se_admin", "rules_admin"],
            "when": {
                "any": [{"roles": "offline"}, {"roles": "biometric"}],
                "n": 2
            }
            "id": "8586d26c"
        }
    ]
}
        </pre>
    <p>In plain english, these rules say:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Let a key have the <a>route</a> and <a>authcrypt</a> privileges when its set of roles contains "cloud".</li>
        <li>Let a key have the <a>authcrypt</a>, <a>plaintext</a> and <a>sign</a> privileges when its set of roles
            contains "edge".</li>
        <li>Let any 2 keys, acting together, have the <a>key_admin</a>, <a>se_admin</a>, and <a>rules_admin</a>
            privileges when their roles each contain either "offline" or "biometric".</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Far more elaborate rules can be constructed. See the <a target="sgl" href="https://evernym.github.io/sgl">
        SGL documentation</a> for details.</p>

        <h4>Privilege Inventory</h4>

        <p>Unlike role names, the privileges named in these rules DO need to be understood by code that parses peer

                that reveals the identity of the sender to the reciever. Most agents are likely to have this privilege,
                but one designed for passive reception only (e.g., on an IoT sensor) might have it removed; doing so
                would prevent a hacker from co-opting such a key into sending in a trusted way. Messages that are
                authcrypted by a key that lacks this privilege should be rejected as illegal.</dd>

                This may actually be a better test for login or authentication, in many cases, than whether a key appears

                <p class="note">Any key holder can sign a DIDComm message; doing so gives non-repudiation to the

                    diplomats versus the president or prime minister of a country&mdash;both are authentic officials,
                    but only the president or prime minister's signature is binding on an international treaty. This
                    privilege makes explicit that sort of special binding-the-owner status; any other signatures
                    serve to prove origin with a specific agent but not the endorsement of the DID subject.

        <h4>Adding a rule</h4>

        <p>Notice that rules have <code>id</code> properties. The IDs for these rules can be assigned by any convenient
            method that provides collision resistance across concurrent updates.
        </p>
        <p>These <code>id</code>s give rules the same <a>CRDT</a> semantics as keys
            and service endpoints&mdash;they can be added or removed with deltas, but never modified. A <a>change
            fragment</a> that adds a new rule might be:
        </p>

        <pre class="example" title="Change fragment that adds a new rule">
{
    "authorization": {
        "rules": [
            {
                "grant": ["route", "authcrypt"],
                "when": {"roles": "cloud"},
                "id": "rule-7"
            }
        ]
    }
}
        </pre>
        <p class="note">Both adding and deleting a rule must be authorized by a key with the <a>key_admin</a> privilege.
            Care should be taken to bundle additions and deletions of rules in such a way that once a full <a>delta</a>
            is applied, the new state provides adequate privileges for all existing keys.
        </p>

        <h4>Deleting a rule</h4>
