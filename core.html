<h2>Core Characteristics</h2>

    <h3>Namestring</h3>
    <p>The namestring that shall identify this DID method is: <code>peer</code></p>
    <p>A DID that uses this method MUST begin with the following prefix: <code>did:peer:</code>.
        Per the DID specification, this string MUST be in lowercase. The remainder of the DID, after the prefix,
        is the <a href="#namespace-specific-identifier-nsi">namespace specific identifier specified below</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="note">Early feedback on this method suggested that we embed it beneath the namespace of a particular
        blockchain, as in <code>did:sov:peer</code> or <a target="_blank"
        href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/didm-veres-one/#veres-one-did-format"><code>did:v1:nym</code></a>.
        However, this DID method is not captive to any particular blockchain, does not take its resolution rules
        from a parent method, and does not require anchoring or reference to a blockchain to be valid.
        Furthermore, any direct or indirect anchoring of a peer DID to a specific blockchain is driven by
        circumstance and changeable at any time. For example, a peer DID could specify that it is using
        a dead drop on blockchain 1, then change to blockchain 2, then change to blockchains 3 and 4 at
        the same time. Therefore, "peer" belongs at the top of the DID namespace. How this method may be
        used in conjunction with various blockchains is discussed <a
                href="#grafting">later</a>.

    <h3>Target System(s)</h3>
    <p>This DID method applies to any identity management implementation that meets the following two
        requirements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Generation Algorithm</em> &mdash; The DIDs are created using the <a href="#namespace-specific-identifier-nsi">
            algorithm described below</a>, endowing them with properties vital to trust between peers that is not
            dependent on a central source of truth.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Protocol</em> &mdash; The metadata for DIDs (what would be stored in an on-chain DID Doc in other methods)
            is communicated and maintained as described in the <a href="#protocols">Protocols</a> section.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Namespace Specific Identifier (NSI)</h3>
    <p>The Peer DID scheme is defined by the following ABNF (see [[RFC5234]] for syntax)</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <code>
            peer-did = "did:peer:" version "-" idstring<br>
            version = "1"<br>
            idstring = multibase multihash<br>
            multibase = "F"</code> <span style="color:green"># See hex in
                <a target="multibase" href="https://github.com/multiformats/multibase">multibase spec</a></span><br>
        <code>multihash = "1220" restofhash</code> <span style="color:green"># See sha256+hex in
                <a target="multihash" href="https://multiformats.io/multihash/">multihash spec</a></span>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Peer DIDs use an underlying number with high entropy, called the <dfn>numeric basis</dfn>, as the
        source of their uniqueness. This version of the spec (<code>version</code>
        == <code>1</code>) generates the numeric basis from a hash of the initial content
        of a DID Doc (see next section). Subsequent versions of the spec may describe
        additional generation methods as needed.</p>
    <p>This <em>numeric basis</em> is encoded as a hash using the
        <a target="multihash" href="https://multiformats.io/multihash/">multihash prefix</a>
        for sha256+hex: "1220". Although this prefix is redundant today, a multihash prefix is used
        so that a different digest or encoding may be selected in the future.</p>
    <p>The multihash value is preceded by a <a target="multibase"
            href="https://github.com/multiformats/multibase">multibase prefix</a> that tells how to
        interpret the multihash that follows. Since the multihash value is hex in
        this version of the spec, <code>multibase</code> is always "F" today; if the
        multihash variant changes in the future, <code>multibase</code> may change, too.
    <p>
    <p class="note">Peer DIDs MUST be compared according to whatever case-sensitivity is implied by the
        hash encoding they use. Hex is not case-sensitive, but if a future version of the spec
        uses <a target="_blank" href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Base58Check_encoding">base58</a> or
        base64 [[RFC4648]] encoding, values will be case sensitive. Therefore, it is required
        that routines that handle peer DIDs not normalize case unless they take into account the
        specific hash encoding.</p>

    <h3>Namestring Generation Method</h3>
    <p>The unique <em>numeric basis</em> underlying a Peer DID MUST be generated as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a <dfn>genesis version</dfn> of JSON text of the DID Doc for the DID. The genesis version MUST
            include enough keys and authorizations that the genesis version of the doc can be signed, to prevent
            man-in-the-middle attacks during initial DID exchange. It SHOULD also include enough state that
            subsequent evolutions to the doc are authorized; otherwise, the doc is a dead end.
            It MUST NOT include the DID itself (either the root <code>id</code> property or its value). This
            lets the doc be created without knowing the DID's value in advance.
            Suppressing the DID value creates a <dfn>stored variant</dfn> of peer DID doc data,
            as opposed to the <dfn>resolved variant</dfn> that would have an actual DID value in the root <code>id
            </code> property. (In either the stored or resolved variant of the doc, anywhere else that the DID value
            would appear, it should appear as a relative reference rather than an absolute value. For example, each
            <code>controller</code> property of a <a href="#publickey">publicKey that is owned by this DID would say
                <code>"controller": "#id"</code></a>.)
        </li>
        <li>Calculate the SHA256 hash of the bytes of the <a>stored variant</a> of the <a>genesis version</a> of the
            DID Doc, and make this value the new DID's <a>numeric basis</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>By basing the numeric value of the DID on the <a>genesis version</a> of the DID Doc, the DID can begin its
        lifecycle with any number of keys and endpoints, and when the doc is signed or auth-encrypted by one
        of the keys, the recipient can know it has not been modified since creation. This guarantees the
        initial integrity of the DID's chain of custody.</p>
    <p>By hashing the stored variant, we avoid the circular problem of including the DID in the data that's being
        hashed. This means that a peer DID doc must be resolved by converting a <a>stored variant</a> of DID Doc
        data into a <a>resolved variant</a> by inserting the value of the DID being resolved, during resolution.</p>

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <p>A convenient regex to match <code>peer</code> DIDs is:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <code>^did:peer:1-F1220[a-fA-F0-9]{8,40}$</code>
    </blockquote>
    <p>A valid <code>peer</code> DID might be:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <code>did:peer:1-F1220479cbc07c3f991725836a3aa2a581ca2029198aa420b9d99bc0e131d9f3e2cbe</code>
    </blockquote>
